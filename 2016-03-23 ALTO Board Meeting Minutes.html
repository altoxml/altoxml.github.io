<b>Minutes</b>
</p>
<p>
The new ALTO icon was discussed. Unfortunately Webex recording wasn't on when we talked about the new ALTO icon.  
My memory wasn't turned on either so I have no notes from the icon discussion :-)
</p>
<p>
Board members agreed to face-to-face meetings at conferences in Santorini, Greece, and Hamburg, Germany. The number of board members meeting in
each of these places will be small (Clemens, Jean Philippe, and Stefan in Santorini and 
Jean Philippe, Clemens, Joachim, Frederick, and maybe Juka in Hamburg).  Three board members will attend WLIC 2016 in Columbus, Ohio, USA, namely,
Raju, Brian, and Frederick; others may attend WLIC 2016 but this is not yet know.  Frederick will arrange for a meeting space in Hamburg and at
WLIC 2016.  (Note: In spite of Hamburg Staats- und Universit√§tsbibliothek's gracious reservation of a meeting room, the meeting in Hamburg was 
canceled because Joachim was ill and because of schedule conflicts.)
</p>
<p>
Joachim lead discussion of <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/26>(issue 26)</a>.  Joachim, Stefan, and Raju discussed this 
change request in 2 separate teleconferences.  See discussion from Mar 23 <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/26#issuecomment-200248481>here</a>, 
<a https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/26#issuecomment-200389704>here</a>, and <a https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/26#issuecomment-200405659>here</a>.

Joachim asks if Tesseract can produce ALTO XML. Stefan says that his Prima Research group has published open source tools to convert various text XML formats 
in its Github <a href=https://github.com/PRImA-Research-Lab>repository</a> as well as some non-open source tools, specifically tools for the
work of the Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis Research Lab. Clemens pointed out that Jukka had added a <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/documentation/wiki>wiki</a> 
for ALTO with a <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/documentation/wiki/Software>Software</a> page; ALTO tools can be added to the Software wiki.
