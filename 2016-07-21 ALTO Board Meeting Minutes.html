Briefly discussed the terms of use for ALTO XML, namely, Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0)</a>.
Clemens has not yet had an opportunity to talk with Armin Talke, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin Legal Advisor for Copyright and related matters. 
Frederick will see Armin at WLIC 2016 and talk with him about ALTO terms of use.  It was noted that the Library of Congress has not (yet?) adopted
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Joachim encouraged all board members to comment on the proposed solution for the Glyphs change request <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/26>(issue 26)</a>
so that the board can vote on the proposed solution and a new version of the schema incorporating the solution can be released.
</p>

<p>
No substantive discussion on the processing history change request.  Issues <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/13>13</a>, 
<a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/27>27</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/35>35</a>, 
and <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/36>36</a> have been merged to create issue <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/39>39</a> Processing history.
Clemens is issue <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/39>39</a>'s champion.  He has organized a separate teleconference discussion for any board member interested in the issue.
The teleconference is scheduled for UTC 14.00 July 27, 2016.
</p>

<p>
Jean Philippe, champion for issue <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/33>33</a> did not attend the meeting, however, Clemens mentioned that he talked with the <a href=http://iiif.io/>IIIF</a> folks.  
<a href=http://iiif.io/>IIIF</a> wants to adopt ALTO XML as its standard for OCR text.  Accordingly, it would like the ALTO board to create / assign a format identifier for ALTO XML, 
for example, a MIME type like <i>application/xml</i> <i>or text/xml</i>, and also to give ALTO a label, for example, <b>ALTO XML</b>
 or <b>ALTO OCR</b>.  Clemens added issue <a href=https://github.com/altoxml/schema/issues/40>40</a> for this change request.
