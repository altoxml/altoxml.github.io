<b>Minutes</b>
</p>

<p>
Frederick reviewed action items and the wiki for the ALTOXML board repository.  Frederick uploaded webex recording from last board meeting
to github; he asks attending board members if this is Ok.  The recordings are useful if someone shows diagrams.  However not everyone may want
their desktop shown to the world.
</p>
<p>
Short discussion about old documents on PBworks.  Evelien mentions that an unused repository will eventually be deleted.
[Action item] Frederick will find out how long PBworks will keep the old board documents before they are deleted.
</p>
<p>
Frederick says that the top 2 candidates for a board face-to-face meeting are iPres 2015 in Chapel Hill NC and DLF 2015 in Vancouver BC.  Jean Philippe
mentions that the METS board plans a workshop and a board meeting at iPres.  Since Jukka, Jean Philippe, Markus, and Nate are members of the METS board and the ALTO board, it 
seems best to have a face-to-face meeting at iPres.  [Action item] Frederick will ask the iPres and DLF organizers if it will be possible to have 
a face-to-face meeting before or after iPres and DLF.
</p>
<p>
Jean Philippe and Evelien lead discussion shape change and text direction (items 22 and 18) after Frederick summarizes the previous discussions about this.
</p>
<p>The ensuing discussion has a lot detail and diagrams.  Best that you listen to the webex recording.  You can find the webex
recording (20120523 ALTO Board Meeting.arf) on a shared Google drive at [URL TBD].</p>
<p>
[Action item] Jean Philippe will write a more complete description of the issues around text direction
and will pester Siang Hock for text direction examples from Chinese.
